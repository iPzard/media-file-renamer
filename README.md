## 🐱‍👤 Develop
Media File Renamer is built with Electron, React, Python, the [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api), and is fully open-source. The technologies are bridged with the help of Electron's [Inter Process Communication](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-main), Node's [child_process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html), and by using Python with [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) as a microservice.<br />
